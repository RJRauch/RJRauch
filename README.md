- 👋 Hi, I’m @RJRauch. 
- 👀 I'm currently studying at Oregon State University to obtain my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering/Development. I graduate in 2023.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSQL, C++, Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, theMERN stack, and Xcode for iOS Development with a touch of Swift. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source climate projects or healthcare software as I have a unique persepctive as an end user of many healthcare electronic medical records as former healthcare provider. 
- Please be patient as I migrate over my local repository to populate my Github with my former and current projects.
