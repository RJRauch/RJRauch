- 👋 Hi, I’m @RJRauch. 
- 👀 I'm currently studying at Oregon State University to obtain my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering/Development. I graduate in 2024.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSQL, C++, Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, and the MERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  healthcare software as I have a unique persepctive as an end user of many healthcare electronic medical records as former healthcare provider. I also have an interest in FinTech. 
- Please be patient as I migrate over my local repository to populate my Github with my former and current projects. 
- 📫 You can reach me at rauchry@oregonstate.edu
